pip_encrypt _final.py is Picture in Picture Encrypter

pip_decrypt_final.py is Picture in Picture Decrypter

Running the above python files would need the libraries "numpy", "Pillow" (PIL), "tkinter" and "cv2", the commands to install these are given below:

pip install numpy

pip install Pillow

pip install tk

pip install opencv-python

Thanks to the Open Source Community, SDSLabs and also to the below mentioned two amazing YT channels.

We took help from the Youtube Channel of Alfredo Sequeida and a video from Computerphile (https://youtu.be/TWEXCYQKyDc) in understanding the concept of Image Steganography and insights on how to implement the same.
