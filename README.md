---------------------

Running the single source code file will give out the application with all the four required options of Text in Image and Image in Image Encryption and Decryption.


Running the above python files would need the libraries "numpy", "Pillow" (PIL), "tkinter" and "cv2", the commands to install these are given below:

```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install Pillow
```
```
pip install tk
```
```
pip install opencv-python
```

Thanks to the Open Source Community, SDSLabs and also to the below mentioned two amazing YT channels.

We took inspiration from the Youtube Channel of Alfredo Sequeida and a [video from Computerphile](https://youtu.be/TWEXCYQKyDc) in understanding the concept of Image Steganography and insights on how to implement the same.
